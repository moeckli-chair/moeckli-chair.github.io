This webpage houses key data on citizens’ initiatives launched at the national level across the 46 member states of the Council of Europe from 1990 to 2020\. The data encompasses information on the types of initiatives, their admissibility, and the signature collection process, offering insights into the actual practice and outcomes of these democratic processes. The data was collected as part of our [LIDD project](https://lidd-project.org).


```{r setup-maping}
library(tidyverse)
library(reactable)
library(here)
library(ggplot2)

df <- read_csv(here("data/raw_02.csv"))
outcome_data <- read_csv(here("data/outcome_data.csv"))

df <- df %>% 
  left_join(outcome_data, by = "Outcome")

unique_scenarios <- df %>% 
  distinct(Definition) %>% 
  pull()

outcome_data <- outcome_data %>% filter(Definition %in% unique_scenarios)

df <- df %>%
  select(Country,Type,Outcome,ID,Definition,Year,Title)

# First get the counts from the original df
outcome_counts <- df %>%
  group_by(Country, Type, Outcome) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = 'drop')

# Create the grouped data and join with counts
grouped_data <- df %>%
  select(Country, Type, Outcome) %>%
  unique() %>%
  left_join(outcome_counts, by = c("Country", "Type", "Outcome"))

## Types of Citizens' Initiatives

In our conceptual framework, we categorize direct-democratic instruments into two primary types: top-down when the process is initiated by institutions and bottom-up when it is initiated by citizens. We identify four types of top-down initiated referendums (that is, popular votes), three triggered by institutional bodies (legislature, executive, and subnational entities) and one automatically triggered when certain conditions specified by law are met, such as a referendum requirement for ratifying constitutional amendments. The bottom-up category comprises two instruments that trigger a popular vote (proactive initiative and rejective initiative) and one that does not (agenda initiative).

### Types of bottom-up instruments (citizens' initiatives)

```{r mapping-definitions}
# Create the data frame from the tab-delimited text
initiative_data <- tribble(
  ~`Type of Initiative`, ~`Short Label`, ~Definition,
  "Proactive initiative", "PI", "Allows a certain number of voters to initiate a referendum and formulate its topic",
  "Rejective initiative", "RI", "Allows a certain number of voters to initiate a referendum that is aimed at (1) preventing constitutional/legislative provisions from being passed or (2) repealing them.",
  "Agenda initiative", "AI", "Allows a certain number of voters to put an issue on the agenda of a state organ, typically parliament, but does not lead to a referendum. An Agenda Initiative that is supported by the required number of signatures obliges parliament to deal with the proposal, that is, to decide on it or, at the very least, to debate it."
  )

## Distribution of bottom-up instruments
Slightly over 70 percent of the Council of Europe member states (33 out of 46) possess at least one form of bottom-up instrument of direct democracy, with some countries having multiple. The PI exists in 20 Council of Europe states, the RI in nine, the AI in 28.

## Mapping initiative practice

Out of the 57 bottom-up instruments that exist in the Council of Europe member states, 17 could not be included in our database. Some instruments could not be included due to the absence of implementation. For example, although the Greek constitution was amended to provide for an AI in 2019, the law required to implement this instrument has not been passed yet. Other instruments were not included because it was impossible to find any information (e.g. for the AI in Armenia), or we considered the information we identified to be unreliable (e.g. for the PI in Poland). Our database thus contains information on 40 instruments.

We applied an inclusion criterion that led to the removal of further eight instruments. Since our empirical goal is to map initiative practice in terms of trends and various outcomes, we excluded those instruments that have been used fewer than five times during the 31 years covered. Where citizens’ initiatives are launched so rarely, there is no meaningful practice to be analysed. This applied to the PI in Albania (n=1), Portugal (n=3), and Serbia (n=2); the RI in Albania (n=2), Luxembourg (n=1), and Malta (n=1); and the AI in Azerbaijan (n=1) and Liechtenstein (n=2). The [Supplemental Material](data/supplemental_material.pdf) provides full details on the instruments that did not satisfy the inclusion criteria as well as those that were included. It also provides details on the cases that were included despite only partial data being available. 

Overall, our database includes information on how 32 bottom-up instruments of direct democracy  have been used in practice, yielding a total of 6,874 citizens’ initiatives launched between 1990 and 2020\.

## Outcomes of Citizens' Initiatives
Before a citizens’ initiative can be put to a referendum or, in the case of the AI, on the agenda of parliament, it normally needs to surmount two important hurdles. First, it needs to pass an admissibility test, that is, a test to determine whether it meets certain legal requirements to proceed. Second, it needs to collect sufficient signatures. The admissibility test can be conducted either before the collection of signatures, acting as a preliminary filter, or after signatures have been gathered, offering a later stage of scrutiny. Our database includes information on both these stages, resulting in various possible outcomes of the initiative process.
