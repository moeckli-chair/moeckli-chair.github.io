Also, the current Constitution replaced the preceding Free State Constitution via plebiscite of the people so any future full revision of the constitutional order would likely require the same approach.","<strong>Comment:<\/strong> There is any specific provision providing for that the territorial change shall triggere a referendum. Since Article 3 of the Constitution specifies that the current territory of the constitutional order is that of the preceding Irish Free State - which is to say the twenty-six counties of the Republic of Ireland, territorial changes, including but not limited to the unification of Ireland, would require amendment of this provision and as amendment of the Constitution can only occur following a referendum, it follows that only indirecly territorial changes trigger a referendum.","<strong>Comment:<\/strong> Article 29 allows the Government (discussed in Article 28) to sign international agreements and ratify international treaties without requiring the triggering of a referendum.","<strong>Comment:<\/strong> There is any specific provision providing for that the ratification of certain international treaties triggers a referendum. In Crotty v An Taoiseach [1987] IR 713 the Supreme Court held that where signing an international treaty would alienate in whole or in part Ireland's sovereign discretion to determine its relations with other nations, it is necessary to have a referendum amending the Constitution to expressly permit the ratification of this treaty. As a result, Ireland's ratification of EU Treaties is indirectly subject to referendum.","<strong>Comment:<\/strong> There is any specific provision providing for that the association with any other state or international organisation triggers a referendum but where the association with any other state or international organisation delimits Ireland's sovereign discretion to determine its relations with other nations, a referendum is necessary to amend the Constitution to expressly authorise this association.","<strong>Comment:<\/strong> There is any specific provision providing for that the association with certain states or international organisations triggers a referendum. It is not the relationship to any particular state or international organisation which triggers the need for a referendum, but rather the content of the agreement and the extent to which it may delimit Ireland's sovereign discretion to determine its relations with other nations.

It only states that the Prime Minister has to publish \"the start and end dates of the signature collection period during which voters may support the request to hold a referendum\". (Art. 5) \nIn this context, it is interesting to refer to the \"Communication du Premier Ministre, Ministre d’Etat, sur base de l’article 5 de la loi du 4 février 2005 relative au référendum au niveau national\". On the second January 2009, the then Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker communicated that the signature period would last from the 19th of January 2009 until the 11th of February 2009. The \"communes\" are usually closed on saturdays and sundays but the law orgnizing the referendum especially states, that the \"communes\" have to be open on saturdays during the signature period.   REfering to the example of 2009, this leaves us at a total of 21 days. \nThe communication is available at the following link: http://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/adm/div/2009/01/02/n1/jo","<strong>Source:<\/strong> Art.10 of the law on referendums on national level of 4 February 2005","<strong>Source:<\/strong> Art.11 of the law on referendums on national level of 4 February 2005",null,"<strong>Source:<\/strong> Art.17 of the law on referendums on national level of 4 February 2005","<strong>Source:<\/strong> Art.17 of the law on referendums on national level of 4 February 2005","<strong>Source:<\/strong> Art.18 of the law on referendums on national level of 4 February 2005"]},"columns":[{"id":"Question","name":"Question","type":"character","width":200},{"id":"Answer","name":"Answer","type":"character","width":200},{"id":"Information","name":"Information","type":"character","html":true}],"defaultPageSize":5,"highlight":true,"outlined":true,"striped":true,"dataKey":"6f76e8245dbd24c0415dcdf359799761","static":false,"nested":true},"children":[]}]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"style":{"padding":"1rem"}},"children":[{"name":"Reactable","attribs":{"data":{"Question":["Is there a formal admissibility check?"],"Answer":["No"],"Information":[null]},"columns":[{"id":"Question","name":"Question","type":"character","width":200},{"id":"Answer","name":"Answer","type":"character","width":200},{"id":"Information","name":"Information","type":"character","html":true}],"defaultPageSize":5,"highlight":true,"outlined":true,"striped":true,"dataKey":"4700dfe45129cecf89ee461bc86f97c8","static":false,"nested":true},"children":[]}]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"style":{"padding":"1rem"}},"children":[{"name":"Reactable","attribs":{"data":{"Question":["Is there a substantive admissibility check?"],"Answer":["No"],"Information":["<strong>Comment:<\/strong> Since the referendum under article 114 of the Constitution is orgnized in order to decide whether or not the text of the consitutional revision should be adopted, there is no need for a substantive admissibility check."]},"columns":[{"id":"Question","name":"Question","type":"character","width":200},{"id":"Answer","name":"Answer","type":"character","width":200},{"id":"Information","name":"Information","type":"character","html":true}],"defaultPageSize":5,"highlight":true,"outlined":true,"striped":true,"dataKey":"80d5c6966a92c04c3994f9cabe39f6ed","static":false,"nested":true},"children":[]}]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"style":{"padding":"1rem"}},"children":[{"name":"Reactable","attribs":{"data":{"Question":["Does the proposal have to be submitted as a (draft) legal text?","Are there any formal limits on the wording of the referendum proposal?"],"Answer":["No","No"],"Information":["<strong>Source:<\/strong> Art. 3 of the law on referendums on national level of 4 February 2005<br><strong>Comment:<\/strong> The proposal has to contain the title and text of the constitutional revision adopted by the Chamber of Deputies at first reading.

According to the Law on Referendum and Other Forms of Direct Expression of Citizens, the referendum could be scheduled for the purpose of deciding or for the purpose of consulting the citizens (Article 8). The decision adopted at a referendum for deciding is binding, but the decision adopted at a referendum for consulting is not binding. The problematic issue here is that in the Article 73 of the Constitution, it is predicted that the decision adopted at a referendum is binding. So, the Constitution is predicting that decisions adopted at referendums are binding, but the Law on Referendum and Other Forms of Direct Expression of Citizens is opening the door for referendums scheduled for the purpose of consulting the citizens. Because of that, the Constitutional Court, several times was deciding about this situation. The decisions of the Constitutional Court supported provisions from the Law on Referendum and Other Forms of Direct Expression of Citizens. According to the Constitutional Court, the Parliament has full right to initiate referendums with the purpose of consulting the citizens. Additionally, the Constitutional Court stated that such a right does not violate the right and obligation of the Parliament to initiate a mandatory referendum in cases which are determined by the Constitution. With that, the Constitutional Court supported the position that the Parliament has the right to initiate referendums for the purpose of consulting the citizens and that in such referendums it is a constitutional right of the Parliament to decide whether, when and how it will regulate the issue for which the citizens were consulted.","<strong>Source:<\/strong> 1.

Eventually, the Senate rejected the President's motion.

Also, the current Constitution replaced the preceding Free State Constitution via plebiscite of the people so any future full revision of the constitutional order would likely require the same approach.","<strong>Comment:<\/strong> There is any specific provision providing for that the territorial change shall triggere a referendum. Since Article 3 of the Constitution specifies that the current territory of the constitutional order is that of the preceding Irish Free State - which is to say the twenty-six counties of the Republic of Ireland, territorial changes, including but not limited to the unification of Ireland, would require amendment of this provision and as amendment of the Constitution can only occur following a referendum, it follows that only indirecly territorial changes trigger a referendum.","<strong>Comment:<\/strong> Article 29 allows the Government (discussed in Article 28) to sign international agreements and ratify international treaties without requiring the triggering of a referendum.","<strong>Comment:<\/strong> There is any specific provision providing for that the ratification of certain international treaties triggers a referendum. In Crotty v An Taoiseach [1987] IR 713 the Supreme Court held that where signing an international treaty would alienate in whole or in part Ireland's sovereign discretion to determine its relations with other nations, it is necessary to have a referendum amending the Constitution to expressly permit the ratification of this treaty. As a result, Ireland's ratification of EU Treaties is indirectly subject to referendum.","<strong>Comment:<\/strong> There is any specific provision providing for that the association with any other state or international organisation triggers a referendum but where the association with any other state or international organisation delimits Ireland's sovereign discretion to determine its relations with other nations, a referendum is necessary to amend the Constitution to expressly authorise this association.","<strong>Comment:<\/strong> There is any specific provision providing for that the association with certain states or international organisations triggers a referendum. It is not the relationship to any particular state or international organisation which triggers the need for a referendum, but rather the content of the agreement and the extent to which it may delimit Ireland's sovereign discretion to determine its relations with other nations.

It only states that the Prime Minister has to publish \"the start and end dates of the signature collection period during which voters may support the request to hold a referendum\". (Art. 5) \nIn this context, it is interesting to refer to the \"Communication du Premier Ministre, Ministre d’Etat, sur base de l’article 5 de la loi du 4 février 2005 relative au référendum au niveau national\". On the second January 2009, the then Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker communicated that the signature period would last from the 19th of January 2009 until the 11th of February 2009. The \"communes\" are usually closed on saturdays and sundays but the law orgnizing the referendum especially states, that the \"communes\" have to be open on saturdays during the signature period.   REfering to the example of 2009, this leaves us at a total of 21 days. \nThe communication is available at the following link: http://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/adm/div/2009/01/02/n1/jo","<strong>Source:<\/strong> Art.10 of the law on referendums on national level of 4 February 2005","<strong>Source:<\/strong> Art.11 of the law on referendums on national level of 4 February 2005",null,"<strong>Source:<\/strong> Art.17 of the law on referendums on national level of 4 February 2005","<strong>Source:<\/strong> Art.17 of the law on referendums on national level of 4 February 2005","<strong>Source:<\/strong> Art.18 of the law on referendums on national level of 4 February 2005"]},"columns":[{"id":"Question","name":"Question","type":"character","width":200},{"id":"Answer","name":"Answer","type":"character","width":200},{"id":"Information","name":"Information","type":"character","html":true}],"defaultPageSize":5,"highlight":true,"outlined":true,"striped":true,"dataKey":"6f76e8245dbd24c0415dcdf359799761","static":false,"nested":true},"children":[]}]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"style":{"padding":"1rem"}},"children":[{"name":"Reactable","attribs":{"data":{"Question":["Is there a formal admissibility check?"],"Answer":["No"],"Information":[null]},"columns":[{"id":"Question","name":"Question","type":"character","width":200},{"id":"Answer","name":"Answer","type":"character","width":200},{"id":"Information","name":"Information","type":"character","html":true}],"defaultPageSize":5,"highlight":true,"outlined":true,"striped":true,"dataKey":"4700dfe45129cecf89ee461bc86f97c8","static":false,"nested":true},"children":[]}]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"style":{"padding":"1rem"}},"children":[{"name":"Reactable","attribs":{"data":{"Question":["Is there a substantive admissibility check?"],"Answer":["No"],"Information":["<strong>Comment:<\/strong> Since the referendum under article 114 of the Constitution is orgnized in order to decide whether or not the text of the consitutional revision should be adopted, there is no need for a substantive admissibility check."]},"columns":[{"id":"Question","name":"Question","type":"character","width":200},{"id":"Answer","name":"Answer","type":"character","width":200},{"id":"Information","name":"Information","type":"character","html":true}],"defaultPageSize":5,"highlight":true,"outlined":true,"striped":true,"dataKey":"80d5c6966a92c04c3994f9cabe39f6ed","static":false,"nested":true},"children":[]}]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"style":{"padding":"1rem"}},"children":[{"name":"Reactable","attribs":{"data":{"Question":["Does the proposal have to be submitted as a (draft) legal text?","Are there any formal limits on the wording of the referendum proposal?"],"Answer":["No","No"],"Information":["<strong>Source:<\/strong> Art. 3 of the law on referendums on national level of 4 February 2005<br><strong>Comment:<\/strong> The proposal has to contain the title and text of the constitutional revision adopted by the Chamber of Deputies at first reading.

According to the Law on Referendum and Other Forms of Direct Expression of Citizens, the referendum could be scheduled for the purpose of deciding or for the purpose of consulting the citizens (Article 8). The decision adopted at a referendum for deciding is binding, but the decision adopted at a referendum for consulting is not binding. The problematic issue here is that in the Article 73 of the Constitution, it is predicted that the decision adopted at a referendum is binding. So, the Constitution is predicting that decisions adopted at referendums are binding, but the Law on Referendum and Other Forms of Direct Expression of Citizens is opening the door for referendums scheduled for the purpose of consulting the citizens. Because of that, the Constitutional Court, several times was deciding about this situation. The decisions of the Constitutional Court supported provisions from the Law on Referendum and Other Forms of Direct Expression of Citizens. According to the Constitutional Court, the Parliament has full right to initiate referendums with the purpose of consulting the citizens. Additionally, the Constitutional Court stated that such a right does not violate the right and obligation of the Parliament to initiate a mandatory referendum in cases which are determined by the Constitution. With that, the Constitutional Court supported the position that the Parliament has the right to initiate referendums for the purpose of consulting the citizens and that in such referendums it is a constitutional right of the Parliament to decide whether, when and how it will regulate the issue for which the citizens were consulted.","<strong>Source:<\/strong> 1.

Eventually, the Senate rejected the President's motion.
