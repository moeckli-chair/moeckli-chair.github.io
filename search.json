    "text": "Mapping initiative practice\nOut of the 57 bottom-up instruments that exist in the Council of Europe member states, 17 could not be included in our database. Some instruments could not be included due to the absence of implementation. For example, although the Greek constitution was amended to provide for an AI in 2019, the law required to implement this instrument has not been passed yet. Other instruments were not included because it was impossible to find any information (e.g. for the AI in Armenia), or we considered the information we identified to be unreliable (e.g. for the PI in Poland). Our database thus contains information on 40 instruments.\nWe applied an inclusion criterion that led to the removal of further eight instruments. Since our empirical goal is to map initiative practice in terms of trends and various outcomes, we excluded those instruments that have been used fewer than five times during the 31 years covered. Where citizens’ initiatives are launched so rarely, there is no meaningful practice to be analysed. This applied to the PI in Albania (n=1), Portugal (n=3), and Serbia (n=2); the RI in Albania (n=2), Luxembourg (n=1), and Malta (n=1); and the AI in Azerbaijan (n=1) and Liechtenstein (n=2). The Supplemental Material provides full details on the instruments that did not satisfy the inclusion criteria as well as those that were included. It also provides details on the cases that were included despite only partial data being available.\nOverall, our database includes information on how 32 bottom-up instruments of direct democracy have been used in practice, yielding a total of 6,874 citizens’ initiatives launched between 1990 and 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribution of citizens’ initiatives"

    "text": "Outcomes of Citizens’ Initiatives\nBefore a citizens’ initiative can be put to a referendum or, in the case of the AI, on the agenda of parliament, it normally needs to surmount two important hurdles. First, it needs to pass an admissibility test, that is, a test to determine whether it meets certain legal requirements to proceed. Second, it needs to collect sufficient signatures. The admissibility test can be conducted either before the collection of signatures, acting as a preliminary filter, or after signatures have been gathered, offering a later stage of scrutiny. Our database includes information on both these stages, resulting in various possible outcomes of the initiative process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutcome variables and their definition"

We identify four types of top-down initiated referendums (that is, popular votes), three triggered by institutional bodies (legislature, executive, and subnational entities) and one automatically triggered when certain conditions specified by law are met, such as a referendum requirement for ratifying constitutional amendments. The bottom-up category comprises two instruments that trigger a popular vote (proactive initiative and rejective initiative) and one that does not (agenda initiative).\nThe typology is presented in the image below (for further information see the definitions).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirect-democratic instruments: Definitions"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Growing dissatisfaction with traditional representative democracy has prompted scholars as well as policy-makers to explore alternative forms of civic engagement and decision-making. Among the most promising alternatives are instruments of direct democracy. As digital advancements reshape how citizens interact among themselves and with the authorities, direct-democratic instruments have gained new prominence in recent years. Offering both direct and semi-direct avenues for influencing policy, they are positioning themselves as significant democratic innovations.\nThe team of Daniel Moeckli’s Chair for Public Law with a focus on International and Comparative Law at the University of Zurich explores direct-democratic mechanisms primarily from a comparative perspective. We often apply an interdisciplinary lens, combining ‘traditional’ legal methods with qualitative and quantitative methods that are more commonly used in other social sciences, especially in political science. Our major research project ‘Popular Sovereignty vs the Rule of Law? Defining the Limits of Direct Democracy’ (LIDD), funded through an ERC Consolidator Grant, was based on this approach. We continue to analyse direct-democratic institutions and practices, adopting a variety of perspectives and integrating different methods.\nThis website presents the most important sets of data we have collected as part of our various research projects relating to direct democracy. These concern the regulation of the different Instruments of direct democracy and the practice of citizens’ Initiatives.\nOur work on direct democracy aligns with the Chair’s overall research agenda to explore issues related to fundamental rights and democracy from the perspectives of comparative constitutional law and international law, applying innovative combinations of promising research methods."
