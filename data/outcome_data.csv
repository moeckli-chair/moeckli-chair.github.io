Outcome,Scenario
FailedPreSignature,Initiative does not collect enough signatures for registration (afterwards theoretically admissibility test)
FailedPostSignature,Initiative did not collect enough signatures for a referendum (afterwards theoretically admissibility test)
PreAdmissible_FailedPostSignature,Initiative is admissible and has enough signatures to get registered but not enough signatures to cause a referendum
AllAdmissible_FailedPostSignature,"There are no requirements for admissibility, initiative did not get enough signatures"
Admissible_FailedPreSignature,"Admissibility test is at the same time as control of signatures needed to get registered, initiative would have been admissible but did not get enough signatures"
Admissible_FailedPostSignature,"Admissibility test is at the same time as control of signatures needed for referendum, initiative would have been admissible but did not get enough signatures"
AllAdmissible,"There are no requirements for admissibility, initiative got enough signatures"
PreAdmissibile_SuccPostSignature,Initiative is admissible and collected enough signatures for a referendum afterwards
PostAdmissible,"Initiative collects enough signatures, initiative is admissible (Admissibility test takes place after signature collection for referendum)"
PreSig_Admissible,"Admissibility test is at the same time as control of signatures needed to get registered, initiative was admissible and got enough signatures"
PostSig_Admissible,"Admissibility test is at the same time as control of signatures needed for referendum, initiative was admissible and got enough signatures"
PostInadmissible,"Initiative collects enough signatures, initiative is inadmissible (Admissibility test takes place after signature collection for referendum)"
PreInadmissible,"initiative is inadmissible, admissibility test takes place before signature collection for referendum"
FailedPreSignature_Inadmissible,"Admissibility test is at the same time as control of signatures needed to get registered, both were unsuccessful"
SuccPreSignature_Inadmissible,"Admissibility test is at the same time as control of signatures need to get registered, initiative was inadmissible"
FailedPostSignature_Inadmissible,"Admissibility test is at the same time as control of signatures needed for referendum, both were unsuccessful"
SuccPostSignature_Inadmissible,"Admissibility test is at the same time as control of signatures needed for referendum, initiative was inadmissible"
Withdrawn,Initiative was withdrawn before full registration
PreAdmissible_Withdrawn,"initiative is admissible, admissibility test takes place before signature collection, initiative gets withdrawn (after admissibility test)"
PostAdmissible_Withdrawn,"initiative is admissible, admissibility test takes place after signature collection, initiative gets withdrawn (after admissibility test)"
PreSignature_Withdrawn,"Initiative got enough signatures to be registered, was withdrawn afterwards"
Post_Signature_Withdrawn,"Initiative got enough signatures for referendum to take place, was withdrawn after successful signature collection"
ProcError,"for example: to register an initiative, a fee needs to be paid in the first three months - the initiants did not pay the fee"
PreAdmissible_ProcError,"Initiative was declared admissible before signature collection for referendum, initiants failed to hand in signature documents in time (example scenario)"
NA,No further information could be found
withdrawn_NA,Initiative was withdrawn at a unknown stage
admissible_NA,Initiative is admissible but no further information was available
inadmissible_NA,Initiative is inadmissible but no further information was available
SuccPostSignature_NA,"Initiative collected enough signatures for referendum, no information on admissibility thereafter"
SuccPreSignature_NA,"Initiative collected enough signatures to get registered, no information afterwards"
Other,This is a special case. More information is in the comment.
